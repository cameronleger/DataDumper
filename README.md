## Overview
DataDumper will dump block or item information as soon as Forge finishes loading. There is no GUI, so all possible exports will be saved in the dump folder of your Minecraft installation.

## Requirements
Minecraft 1.7.10
FML 1.7.10-10.13.4.1448
Although, this can probably be adapted to other versions with little effort.

## Installation
Place the .jar in yours mods directory.
